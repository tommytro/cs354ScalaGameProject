## Farming in Scala Final Project 

 * Authors: Tommy Trovinger, Josh Fenske, Lukas Karlsson, Sayre Peterson 
 * Class: CS354
 * Semester: Fall 2022


## About The Project

The goal of this project was to learn a new language by creating a project that utilized the language. We chose to use Scala, which is both
an object-oriented and functional programming language.

In its current state, our project allows a user to navigate a small map and plant seeds, which progress into fully grown plants. 
The user has a Minecraft like inventory system, that is displayed in the bottom left corne of the screen. 
Right now, the user spawns with a hoe, watering pot and seven different types of seeds which can be planted 
by simply pressing the space bar while the seed is selected. 
There is currently no use for the hoe and watering pot as we were mainly concerned with getting plant growth working. 
There is also no use for the plants once they have grown. Plants reach full gorth in less than a minute for testing purposes. 
Essentially, Farming in Scala is a simple demonstration of a map and character using pixel art.


## Installing and Running the Program

There are two different ways to run the program:

Method 1: 
    Since we are using gradle paired with libgdx, we are able to compile our program into a .jar file,
    which makes sharing and running pretty easy, this file is located in the directory: 
    
    \cs354ScalaGameProject\desktop\build\libs\desktop-1.0.jar

    Our .jar is also avaible at the following link as "desktop-1.0.jar":
    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ex-JPSfJS43eoS_tTUp8FjFZNZJNBZqm

    If you are using Java 8 or above this file should execute with no issues. 

Method 2: 
    You can also run our code straight from the repository. Do to this you will need to do a bit of setup:
        * Download and install gradle: https://gradle.org/install/ 
        * The repo folder (cs354ScalaGameProject) has gradle folders that are correctly setup. All you need 
          to do now is run the following command: ./gradlew desktop:run
        * Our source code should compile after a few seconds and open in a new window!
        * Side note: If you want to make a new .jar file, you can type ./gradlew desktop:dist to create a new .jar file. 
          This new file can be found in the same location as discussed in method 1. 


## Usage

While in game, press H to view the command list for the game, WASD controls move the character. Have fun!
